## Albumentations & GradCam + Quiz

1. Apply tranformations using library Albumentations. Apply ToTensor, HorizontalFlip, Normalize (at min) + More (for additional points)
2. Please make sure that your test_transforms are simple and only using ToTensor and Normalize
3. Implement GradCam function as a module. 
4. Your final code (notebook file) must use imported functions to implement transformations and GradCam functionality
5. Target Accuracy is 87%

## Results

1. Accuracy is 86.28% at Epoch 22
2. Number of Epochs 22
