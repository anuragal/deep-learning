# DNN

DNN which stands for Deep Neural Network is a similar approach in trying to replicate how our brain functions. As per a study our brain reads images in layers like in the form of edges then these edges are converted to part of object and then in final step they are converted to object.

Using Convolution the images are proccessed and their patterns are learned so that some prediction is made about the image

# How this works

1. Extract features from image using kernels
2. Kernel extract the feature, similar features form feature map
3. Kernels are initialized with random values less then zero, once search algorithm starts it re-initialized the kernel with proper values
4. Convolution is used to process the images
5. Breaking the image into individual components so that they start making sense
