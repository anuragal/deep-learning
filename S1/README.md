## Learnings from first Session

1. [Channels and Kernels](https://github.com/anuragal/deep-learning/blob/master/S1/Channels-Kernels.md) (according to EVA)
2. [3x3 kernels](https://github.com/anuragal/deep-learning/blob/master/S1/3x3-kernels.md)
3. How many times to we need to perform 3x3 convolutions operations to reach close to 1x1 from 199x199 (type each layer output like 199x199 > 197x197...)
4. How are kernels initialized? 
5. What happens during the training of a DNN?
