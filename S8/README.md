## Resnet18

1. Extract the ResNet18 model and add it to your API/repo. 
2. Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
3. Your Target is 85% accuracy. 
4. No limit on the number of epochs. 
5. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed).

### Results

1. Accuracy is 86.28% at Epoch 22
2. Number of Epochs 22
